Motor should be slightly modified to assemble the device: 

* Phase wires should be rerouted straight down and trimmed to ~30-35 mm (measuring from the bottom of the motor).
The ends of the wires (3-5 mm) should be tinned.
* Two pieces of thin wires (0.3-0.6 mm dia) should be soldered to the thermistor prior to its installataion. 
The wires' length should be ~35-45 mm. The ends of the wires (3-5 mm) should be tinned.
* The thermistor should be glued directly to the motor windings with epoxy resin
(care must be taken to avoid ingress of epoxy to the motor bearing).

Thermal pad has the shape of a circle with a diameter of 40-42 mm, 1 mm thickness.
[Arctic thermal pad](https://www.arctic.ac/worldwide_en/thermal-pad.html) is recommended.
