The motor should be slightly modified to assemble the device:

* Phase wires should be rerouted straight down and trimmed to ~30-35 mm (measuring from the bottom of the motor).
The ends of the wires (3-5 mm) should be tinned.

* Two pieces of thin wires (0.3-0.6 mm dia) should be soldered to the thermistor prior to its installataion.
The wires' length should be ~35-45 mm. The ends of the wires (3-5 mm) should be tinned.

* The thermistor should be glued directly to the motor windings with epoxy resin
(care must be taken to avoid ingress of epoxy into the motor bearing).

**The phase wires shall be soldered such that a positive setpoint drives the motor clockwise (viewed from the top).**
If the observed direction is different, any two phase wires of the three are to be swapped.

The thermal pad has the shape of a circle with a diameter of 40-42 mm, 1 mm thickness.
