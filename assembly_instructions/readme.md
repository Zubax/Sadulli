Motor should be slightly modified to assemble the device: 

* Phase wires should be rerouted straight down and trimmed to ~30-40 mm (measuring from the bottom of the motor). 
* The thermistor should be glued directly to the motor windings with epoxy resin (care must be taken to avoid ingress of epoxy to the motor bearing).

Thermal pad has the shape of a circle with a diameter of 40-42 mm. Its thickness is 1 mm. [Arctic thermal pad](https://www.arctic.ac/worldwide_en/thermal-pad.html) is recommended

Motor is mounted with  4 [DIN 7984 4 mm screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/92855a301).

Housing is held together with 4 [DIN 965 20 mm screws](https://www.mcmaster.com/91420a026).
